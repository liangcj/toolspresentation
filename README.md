# tools presentation

Short, informal presentation on workflow tools for a statistician. Sharing here for working group members who attended my presentation/discussion.

If you stumbled on this page some other way, I recommend just checking out [Jenny Bryan's presentation](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/2015/02/318-4374) which is much more thoroughly organized and detailed.
